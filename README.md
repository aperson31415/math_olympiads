# Mathematics
## Olympiads
Lots of resources for Australian Mathematical Competitions
Past papers for most competitions
Books to help
## Proofs
I will just add random stuff here that I'm interested
## Programs
Has various maths programs mostly in python, might have to install some packages with pip
## Random stuff
Like calculus, googology and other topics
Includes some bad-quality books
## MO App.py
You need python for this application.
To use this, make a new folder in your computer, and add the "images" file.
Then add all/some of the MO files here to the same folder as MO App.py (keep them in their folders)
