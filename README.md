# Mathematical Olympiads

## Rework Notes
Due to the immense number of resources I have found (more to be added in the coming days), this repo now ONLY includes Mathematical Olympiads.
Additionally, I have excluded lots of books, either because they are paid, or there are similar books covering almost exactly the same content.

Additionally, simpler contests such as Math Kangaroo, AMC, KSF and others are excluded from this repo because they are too simple, and if you are at this level and know about them, just ask your teacher for some past questions.

## App Notes
To use `MO APP.py`, you need to first have python, or cython. Then put all competition folders (without parent folders like 'Australia') into the same subdirectory as the app, and add all books in a separate folder, also in the same directory
